## Optimizations

An update/refactoring of the Records page is currently in development, as well as a Settings page to adjust User Settings (like light/dark themes).
Planned future optimizations include ongoing improvements to user interface and navigation.

## Lessons Learned

I knew I wanted to maintain an MVC structure to maintain organization during development to allow future improvements or post-launch additions. New
Features can easily be worked into a new or existing model, followed by logic and data retrieval within the controllers(API).

It was import to work on creating a modern styling for this project, and I knew I was going to use TailwindCSS to achieve that result. I did lean
heavily on DaisyUI for components and addition UI support for a clean aesthetic and user-friendly experience.

A good portion of my owrk was spent researching package libraries' respective documentation to troubleshoot issues encountered along the way.
